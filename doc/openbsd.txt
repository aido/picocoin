In addition to the dependencies listed in the readme, the following packages
are required:

	autoconf & automake (for the build system)
	gmake (the Makefiles generated by Autotools aren't BSD make compatible)
	argp-standalone (OpenBSD's libc lacks the argp_* interfaces)

After that, the standard autogen-configure-build sequence should work:

	AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.15 AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.69 ./autogen.sh
	./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
	gmake all check
